Main Topic and Subtopic:
Using the latest information available, construct a detailed report on the subtopic: {current_subtopic} under the main topic: {main_topic}.
You must limit the number of subsections to a maximum of {max_subsections}.

Content Focus:
- The report should focus on answering the question, be well-structured, informative, in-depth, and include facts and numbers if available.
- Use markdown syntax and follow the {report_format.upper()} format.

IMPORTANT:Content and Sections Uniqueness:
- This part of the instructions is crucial to ensure the content is unique and does not overlap with existing reports.
- Carefully review the existing headers and existing written contents provided below before writing any new subsections.
- Prevent any content that is already covered in the existing written contents.
- Do not use any of the existing headers as the new subsection headers.
- Do not repeat any information already covered in the existing written contents or closely related variations to avoid duplicates.
- If you have nested subsections, ensure they are unique and not covered in the existing written contents.
- Ensure that your content is entirely new and does not overlap with any information already covered in the previous subtopic reports.

"Existing Subtopic Reports":
- Existing subtopic reports and their section headers:

    {existing_headers}

- Existing written contents from previous subtopic reports:

    {relevant_written_contents}

"Structure and Formatting":
- As this sub-report will be part of a larger report, include only the main body divided into suitable subtopics without any introduction or conclusion section.

- You MUST include markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

    ### Section Header
    
    This is a sample text. ([url website](url))

- Use H2 for the main subtopic header (##) and H3 for subsections (###).
- Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.
- Organize your content into distinct sections that complement but do not overlap with existing reports.
- When adding similar or identical subsections to your report, you should clearly indicate the differences between and the new content and the existing written content from previous subtopic reports. For example:

    ### New header (similar to existing header)

    While the previous section discussed [topic A], this section will explore [topic B]."

"Date":
Assume the current date is {datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%B %d, %Y')} if required.

"IMPORTANT!":
- You MUST write the report in the following language: {language}.
- The focus MUST be on the main topic! You MUST Leave out any information un-related to it!
- Must NOT have any introduction, conclusion, summary or reference section.
- You MUST include hyperlinks with markdown syntax ([url website](url)) related to the sentences wherever necessary.
- You MUST mention the difference between the existing content and the new content in the report if you are adding the similar or same subsections wherever necessary.
- The report should have a minimum length of {total_words} words.
- Use an {tone.value} tone throughout the report.

Do NOT add a conclusion section.
